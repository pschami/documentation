Contributing to Project Symphony
================================

While you can access our source code for a project, service, or application, we hope you’ll consider contributing back to the code base with improvements, new features, and fixes.

Why contribute? Providing feedback allows others to further enhance your code. If others give back, you can take advantage of their contributions. We include contributed improvements in our automated test environment in subsequent releases. If you don't give back your improvements, you'll need to retest your changes every time you deploy a new version of Project Symphony.

Contributor agreement
---------------------
All contributions are made under the code by Dell EMC Contributor Agreement  `Contributor Agreement < https://github.com/codedellemc/codedellemc.github.io/wiki/Contributor-Agreement/>`_.

Submitting contributions
------------------------

Project Symphony takes contributions through GitHub pull requests. To submit coding additions or changes for a repository, fork the repository and clone it locally. Then use a unique branch to make commits and send pull requests.

Limit a pull request to a single issue. Make sure to provide a clear and complete description of the pull request.

Run your changes against existing tests or create new tests to cover your implementation. Keep tests as simple as possible. At a minimum, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project. For more information about contributing changes to Project Symphony, see the :ref:`developmentguide-label`

We will review your contributions and engage with you with any questions or if further changes are required. The core committers handle all merges.
