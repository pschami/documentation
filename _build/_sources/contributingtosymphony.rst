Contributing to Symphony
========================

Welcome to Project Symphony.

As this project is new to the Open Source communities our guidelines are also new and in it's infancy stage and well grow over time. Bear with us as we improve this experience.

Open Source for us has two big components:

* Providing access to the source code for a project, service or application.

* Contributing back into the code base with fixes, improvements and new features that you've created.

We are looking forward to your contributions into this project and all the code-bases provided. While it can sound like you're giving away your work for free, it's almost always better to give the changes you make back to Dell EMC than keeping them them solely to yourself. Here are a couple of reasons why;

1. If you give back the improvements you made, someone else could further improve your code, and when they give that back, you get to take advantage of that additional improvement. It's a virtuous circle.

2. If you don't give back your improvements, you'll need to retest your changes every time you deploy a new version of Symphony (which could be as frequently as every two weeks). Giving your improvements back to Dell EMC allow us to include them in our automated test environment, meaning that they are automatically tested every new release. You get the benefit of writing your own new features without having to keep changing your software so it continues to work with the latest version of Project Symphony.

3. This means that in many cases, rather than waiting for Dell EMC to develop an important feature, you'll often be able to adapt something that already exists and have it working way before you'd get it using non-open source software.

Giving back is known as contributing. In addition to the good reasons above, you'll also be known as someone who is an active contributor to Project Symphony community, and get your name on the contributor's board, if we were to ever implement such a feature. Right now though, we're hard at work building the features that everyone needs, so it may be a while...

Submitting contributions
------------------------

To submit coding additions or changes for a repository, fork the repository and clone it locally. Then use a unique branch to make commits and send pull requests.

Keep your pull requests limited to a single issue. Make sure that the description of the pull request is clear and complete.

Run your changes against existing tests and create new tests to cover your implementation. Keep tests as simple as possible. At a minimum, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project. For more information about contributing changes to Symphony, please see `Contributing Changes to Symphony
<https://wiki.ent.vce.com/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=VSE&title=Contributing+Changes+to+Symphony&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=76680026>`_.

After receiving the pull request, our core committers will give you feedback on your work and may request that you make further changes and resubmit the request. The core committers will handle all merges.

If you have questions about the disposition of a request, feel free to email one of our core committers.

Reporting security issues or concerns
-------------------------------------
If you come across a vulnerability within the code/product and or some security concern please email symphony@dell.com.

No need to create an Issue/Bug as above. As this will be taken care of by the team - However please provide as much information as possible in the email.

Submitting design proposals
---------------------------
Significant feature and design proposals are expected to be proposed on the mailing list (dellemc-symphony@googlegroups.com, or at groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/symphony) for discussion. The Core Committer team reviews the proposals to make sure architectural details are aligned. Feel free to help expand the code too if you so desire.

Coding guidelines
-----------------

Use the same coding style as the rest of the codebase. In general, write clean code and supply meaningful and comprehensive code comments.

For more detailed information about how we’ve set up our code, please see our Symphony Development Guide.
