==========================

Dell Project Symphony is a Dell EMC initiative to develop embedded software-defined operations features for Dell EMC Converged Systems, such as Dell EMC VxRack FLEX. It eliminates routine manual system administration, enabling you to use the infrastructure to solve business problems.

IT staff spends less time managing infrastructure as Project Symphony software-defined operations enable continuous, automated infrastructure changes to maximize data center agility, asset usage, and fitness. Project Symphony understands how to make changes to infrastructure without compromising system fitness.

Developers, including the Dell EMC customer and partner community, third-party developers, and Dell EMC engineering, can collaborate to quickly add new software-defined operations capabilities. They can then share these innovations with the user community to solve common IT challenges.

The project is available `here
